          Igniting Insight, as the name suggests, is a humble effort by a group of undergraduate students, to ignite the curiosity to learn and understand, in young creative minds.
          It is this vision that is showcased through our logo. The minds of the students and the teacher, meshed in perfect harmony,that symbolises the fact that effective learning happens only when the teacher has as much enthusiasm to teach as the student has, to learn.

We, as a team of undergraduate students aim to teach underprivileged students and provide them with resources needed to aid them in effective learning.

            IGNITING INSIGHT was formed by a group of undergraduate students in May 2020, some more students joined the organisation to contribute to the cause, who shared a common goal that is to provide underprivileged students with the resources that could help make learning easier and more enjoyable for them. This vision is what spearheaded our organisation.
            <br>
            <br>
            To provide quality education to those deprived of resources, and the belief that a lack of resources should never be the reason a child, with the ambition to learn, is devoid of it, are what drives this organisation.

          <div class="about_us-row_content">
            Igniting Insight started out as an organisation managed by a small group of undergraduate students with high spirits and limited resources in the month of May 2020. While our resources were limited, our belief in the organisation and its vision was tremendous, and it is with this belief that Igniting Insight organised its first event i.e. Workshop-I in the month of June-July. This workshop was to include subjects like Science, Maths and English and was organised for students from grade 5th to 8th. While the subjects remained the same, the workshop did not adhere to the syllabus defined by any educational board, but rather focused on a certain set of conceptual topics and ensured that all concepts pertaining to them were made clear to each student. In addition to the three subjects mentioned above, the workshop also included an additional subject, Indian Knowledge and Tradition to provide students with an insight into the rich culture and tradition of India. On conclusion of the workshop, an event i.e. IIGT (Igniting Insight’s Got Talent) was also organised for students to showcase their talents in music, art, dance, and other recreational activities to promote holistic growth and learning.
            <br><br>            
            We received an amazing response for Workshop-I, from both students and parents, and in the month of August welcomed a new set of people to the organisation, those who shared the same goal and vision as the organisation and would help it grow. In the month of September, we expanded our team by conducting a recruitment drive in which we selected interested volunteers to help us in the cause by interviewing them and welcoming them to the Team Igniting Insight !

                With a bigger team in place, Igniting Insight collaborated  with Vivekananda Youth Forum (VYF) a NGO, to teach students from economically weaker backgrounds and provide them with all the help they needed in strengthening key concepts.

            In the month of November, Igniting Insight organised it’s second workshop i.e. Workshop-II for students from grade 5th to 8th. While Workshop-II was similar to workshop-I in terms of the way it was organised, our new and bigger team ensured that we could take a greater number of classes for each subject as well as tackle more concepts in greater detail, laying the foundation for our students to build their ambitions on.
